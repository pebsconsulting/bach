Bach Contributors
=================

Free and Open Source software is a gift to the commons. There are many ways to
contribute: code, documentation, testing, feedback, community support. All of
this is important and valued work.

This document lists all significant contributors to Bach, in alphabetical order
of first name or nickname, and their organisation if contributing in an
official capacity.
